# Issue 092625-22: Golf Tab – DG +EV List

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS / UI (Golf)  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (golf feature)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Implement the Golf tab showing players/events with DataGolf win probabilities compared to market odds, highlighting +EV items with a toggle to show only DG+EV.

## Investigation Areas

1. List design for golfer + event + EV fields.  
2. Toggle/filter to show only DG+EV.  
3. Handling of ongoing vs upcoming events.  

## Expected Behavior

Users can view DG-based EV opportunities for golf, filter to only +EV, and see key fields (golfer, event, DG prob, best market odds, EV%).

## Files to Investigate

- `frontend/Sources/Features/Golf/GolfView.swift` (to be added)  
- `frontend/Sources/Features/Golf/GolfViewModel.swift` (to be added)  
- `frontend/Sources/Models/Golf.swift`  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No dedicated Golf UI exists.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Requires DG + odds join.  
3. **Why It Happened**: New feature.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Golf List and Toggle (⏳ In Progress)
- Implement list and toggle; wire to `/api/golf` backend.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new SwiftUI views will be added`

**Before**:
```text
No Golf tab UI.
```

**After**:
```text
frontend/Sources/Features/Golf/GolfView.swift
frontend/Sources/Features/Golf/GolfViewModel.swift
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Load Golf tab; verify +EV highlights.  
2. Toggle "Only DG+EV"; confirm filtering.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Loading/error/empty states handled  
- [ ] EV values align with backend  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Implement list and toggle  
- [ ] Bind to backend `/api/golf`  
- [ ] Render DG prob, odds, EV  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Golf list and toggle functional  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates EV/UI on a live event  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Golf tab provides clear DG-driven +EV opportunities with filtering.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm EV threshold for "DG+EV" highlight.  
- Confirm fields shown per row.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Golf UI implemented and wired.  
- User confirms threshold and field set.
