# Issue 092625-16: Caching, Rate Limits, and Error Handling

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Backend / Reliability  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (stability for first use)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Resolved**: 2025-09-26

## Problem Description

Add caching, request timeouts/retries, and graceful error handling for upstream API failures, returning HTTP 503 when appropriate and logging details.

## Investigation Areas

1. fastapi-cache or per-service memoization  
2. httpx/requests timeouts and retry strategy  
3. Structured logging format and correlation ids  

## Expected Behavior

Endpoints remain responsive; transient upstream failures do not crash the app; callers get clear 5xx/4xx codes and logs contain actionable details.

## Files to Investigate

- `backend/app/services/*.py`  
- `backend/app/main.py` and middleware  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No resilience patterns implemented.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Multiple external APIs  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early MVP stage  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Caching (✅ Complete)
- TTL cache for Polymarket and Odds services (per-params), keyed and honoring `REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.  

### 2. Timeouts/Retries (✅ Complete)
- Shared `http_get_with_retry` helper with exponential backoff applied to Polymarket and Odds services; retries only on transport errors and 5xx.  

### 3. Error Handling (✅ Complete)
- Odds route maps upstream errors to the real status code (e.g., 404) with response detail; Polymarket used internally by aggregator.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `backend/app/services/*`

**Before**:
```text
Direct upstream calls; no cache/retry; generic errors.
```

**After**:
```text
Calls wrapped with cache + retry; upstream errors surfaced with accurate status codes.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Call `/api/odds/{sport}` with an invalid sport key; verify non-500 status (e.g., 404) is returned.  
2. Call a valid odds endpoint twice; verify the second call returns faster due to cache.  

### Test Scenarios
- [x] Retries capped and backoff applied  
- [x] Cache TTL respected  

## Status

**Current Status**: RESOLVED  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Add caching layer  
- [x] Configure timeouts/retries  
- [x] Implement error mapping/logging  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [x] Resilience behavior verified  
- [x] Ready for user testing  
- [x] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [x] User validates reliability under light network issues  
- [x] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Backend is resilient with cache, retries, and clear upstream error responses.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm default TTLs and retry counts/backoff.  
- Confirm error schema/messages acceptable for UI.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Resilience patterns implemented and verified.  
- User confirms TTLs/retry settings and error responses.
