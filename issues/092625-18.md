# Issue 092625-18: CI for Backend (GitHub Actions)

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: DevOps / CI  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (ensures build/test on PRs)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Set up CI to run linting, tests, and build the backend container on pushes/PRs, surfacing coverage and failing on red.

## Investigation Areas

1. GitHub Actions workflow for Python 3.11  
2. Cache pip deps and restore on subsequent runs  
3. Build container and optionally push on main  

## Expected Behavior

PRs trigger CI that runs lint/test; main builds container; coverage summary appears in logs.

## Files to Investigate

- `.github/workflows/backend.yml` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No CI in place.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: New repo.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early stage.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CI Workflow (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Install deps, run lint/tests, compute coverage.  
- Build container; optionally publish on main (guard secrets).  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new workflow to be added`

**Before**:
```text
No CI pipeline.
```

**After**:
```text
.github/workflows/backend.yml
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open PR; verify checks run and status reported.  
2. Merge to main; verify build step runs.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Fail on lint/test errors  
- [ ] Coverage reported  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add workflow file  
- [ ] Configure cache and coverage  
- [ ] Build container on main  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] CI green on PR  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User sees CI status on PRs  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Backend has CI with lint/test/coverage and container build for reliability.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Add any required GitHub secrets for container registry (if publishing).  
- Confirm whether to publish images on main.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- CI workflow active and passing.  
- User confirms publish settings and secrets.
