# Issue 092625-42: Frontend Wiring (Minimal): Sport, EV Baseline, Freshness, Provenance

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Frontend / iOS  
**Beta Blocker**: No (but needed for visibility)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Awaiting User Testing  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Wire the All Sports list to show populated `sport`, EV baseline (0) with a “No comparison” badge, and freshness indicator. Provide a dev toggle to view provenance on detail.

## Investigation Areas

1. DTO updates and Codable models.  
2. UI badges for EV basis and freshness.  
3. Dev-mode reveal of provenance/calculation notes.

## Expected Behavior

All Sports displays sport and freshness. EV shows 0 with a neutral badge when `comparison_basis=none`. Dev mode shows provenance in detail.

## Files to Investigate

- `frontend/` view models and views  
- `frontend/` models for DTOs  
- Settings toggles

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: New fields not yet surfaced in UI.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Early backend-first iteration.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Minimal Wiring (✅ Complete)
- Update models and decoding for new fields.  
- Add sport and freshness to list row.  
- Add "No comparison" badge when basis is none.  
- Dev toggle to view provenance in detail.

### Code Changes

**Files Modified**: `frontend/Sources/...`

**Before**:
```text
Fields not shown; EV baseline unclear.
```

**After**:
```text
Sport, freshness, and EV basis surfaced; optional provenance in dev mode.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Run the app; verify list shows sport and freshness.  
2. Enable dev mode; inspect provenance in detail.

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Decoding includes new fields  
- [ ] UI shows EV basis and freshness  
- [ ] Dev toggle reveals provenance

## Status

**Current Status**: Awaiting User Testing  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-27

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Update models and views  
- [x] Add badges/indicators  
- [ ] Manual smoke on simulator

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Visible fields in UI  
- [ ] App builds clean

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates visibility and clarity  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete

### User Confirmation & Actions Required
- None.

## Result

All Sports shows sport, EV basis badge, and staleness; model decoding updated.
