# Issue 092625-19: SwiftUI App Scaffold (iOS 17+)

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS / SwiftUI  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (frontend entrypoint)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Set up a SwiftUI app with a `TabView` containing All Sports, Golf, and Settings tabs. Establish navigation and theme.

## Investigation Areas

1. Project settings (bundle id, deployment target iOS 17)  
2. App structure and navigation patterns  
3. Basic styling and icons  

## Expected Behavior

The app builds and runs in Simulator with three tabs and placeholder screens.

## Files to Investigate

- `frontend/` Xcode project (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No iOS project exists yet.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Multi-tab structure needed.  
3. **Why It Happened**: New frontend.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. SwiftUI Scaffold (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Create project, add `TabView`, and placeholders for each tab.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new Xcode project will be added`

**Before**:
```text
No iOS app.
```

**After**:
```text
frontend/PolymarketEdge.xcodeproj
frontend/Sources/... SwiftUI views
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Build and run on Simulator.  
2. Navigate between tabs; verify stable.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] App launches without errors  
- [ ] Tabs render placeholders  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create Xcode project  
- [ ] Add TabView and screens  
- [ ] Commit build settings
