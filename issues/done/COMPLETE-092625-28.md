# Issue 092625-28: Documentation – README and API Docs

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Docs  
**Beta Blocker**: No (but required for onboarding)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Write root README and API documentation covering local dev, environment variables, endpoints, and deploy runbooks.

## Investigation Areas

1. README structure and quickstart flow  
2. API endpoint descriptions and examples  
3. Runbooks for local and deploy  

## Expected Behavior

New contributors can get started quickly; API users can understand endpoints and required params; deploy steps are documented.

## Files to Investigate

- `README.md` (to be added/expanded)  
- `docs/api.md` (to be added)  
- `docs/runbooks/*` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: Minimal/no docs exist.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: New monorepo.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early stage.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Documentation (⏳ In Progress)
- Expand README, add API docs, and runbooks for local/deploy.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new docs to be added`

**Before**:
```text
Sparse docs.
```

**After**:
```text
README.md
docs/api.md
docs/runbooks/local.md
docs/runbooks/deploy.md
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Follow quickstart from a clean machine; verify success.  
2. Hit endpoints using examples in docs.  

### Test Scenarios
- [x] Quickstart leads to working local env  
- [x] API examples work as described  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26
