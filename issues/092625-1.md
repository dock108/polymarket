# Issue 092625-1: Initialize Monorepo and Repo Scaffolding

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Repo / Scaffolding  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (foundation for all work)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

The repository lacks an initial monorepo structure and baseline developer ergonomics. We need a standard layout with `/backend`, `/frontend`, and `/docs`, along with a root `README`, `.gitignore`, and environment/bootstrap scripts to enable rapid setup and collaboration.

## Investigation Areas

1. Confirm monorepo layout from `plan.md` and align directory names.  
2. Determine language/tooling versions and baseline editor/formatter configs.  
3. Identify minimal bootstrap scripts required for local setup (e.g., `make` or shell scripts).  

## Expected Behavior

The repo has a clear monorepo structure with empty but documented components (`/backend`, `/frontend`, `/docs`). Root documentation explains how to get started and how components are organized. Developers can clone and immediately navigate the structure.

## Files to Investigate

- `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/polymarket/plan.md` (authoritative plan)
- `/Users/michaelfuscoletti/Desktop/polymarket/STANDARDIZED_CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` (team rules)
- `.gitignore` patterns for Python/Swift/Node as needed

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No initial scaffolding exists.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Multi-stack project requires clear separation.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Project not yet initialized.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Create Monorepo Directories (⏳ In Progress)
- Add `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/docs` directories.  
- Include placeholder `README.md` files.  

### 2. Root Documentation and Ignore Files (⏳ In Progress)
- Add root `README.md` outlining architecture at a glance.  
- Add language-appropriate `.gitignore`.  

### 3. Bootstrap Scripts (⏳ In Progress)
- Add `scripts/` folder with `bootstrap.sh` to set up local environment.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new files/directories will be created`

**Before**:
```text
No monorepo structure exists.
```

**After**:
```text
/backend
/frontend
/docs
README.md
.gitignore
scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Clone repo and verify new directories exist.  
2. Open root `README.md` and confirm quickstart instructions.  
3. Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` and confirm it completes without errors.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Repo structure visible after fresh clone  
- [ ] Root docs provide clear quickstart  
- [ ] Bootstrap script runs successfully  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Root `.gitignore` created  
- [ ] Root `README.md` created  
- [ ] `/backend`, `/frontend`, `/docs` created  
- [ ] `scripts/bootstrap.sh` created  
- [ ] Verified repo structure on fresh clone  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Code compiles without errors (N/A for scaffolding)  
- [ ] All tests pass (N/A)  
- [ ] Feature/fix is functional (structure is present)  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User has reviewed repository structure  
- [ ] User confirms structure aligns with `plan.md`  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

The project is set up as a monorepo with clearly defined directories, initial docs, and bootstrap script(s), enabling subsequent backend and frontend tasks.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Create/confirm the GitHub repository and default branch.  
- Confirm monorepo directory names match your preference.  
- Confirm the presence and content of root `README.md`.  
- Confirm `.gitignore` meets needs for Python, Swift, and Docker.  
- Confirm `scripts/bootstrap.sh` behavior on your machine.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Monorepo directories exist and are committed.  
- Root `README.md` and `.gitignore` exist and are reviewed.  
- Bootstrap script runs locally without errors.  
- User has confirmed structure and documentation as acceptable.
