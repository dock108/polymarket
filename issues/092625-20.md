# Issue 092625-20: iOS Networking Layer and Models

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: iOS / Networking  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (data for tabs)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Implement a lightweight networking client using async/await with `URLSession`, define `Codable` models to consume backend endpoints, and basic error handling.

## Investigation Areas

1. API base URL configuration (dev vs prod)  
2. Codable models for opportunities, odds by sport, and golf  
3. Simple retry/backoff for transient errors  

## Expected Behavior

Networking layer fetches and decodes backend responses; errors are shown as basic states; refresh interval configurable.

## Files to Investigate

- `frontend/Sources/Networking/*` (to be added)  
- `frontend/Sources/Models/*` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No networking in iOS app yet.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Multiple endpoints and filters.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Follows backend API creation.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Client and Models (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Add API client, endpoints, and DTOs; handle decoding errors.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new iOS files will be added`

**Before**:
```text
No networking layer.
```

**After**:
```text
frontend/Sources/Networking/APIClient.swift
frontend/Sources/Models/Opportunity.swift
frontend/Sources/Models/Odds.swift
frontend/Sources/Models/Golf.swift
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Point app to local backend; verify fetches work.  
2. Toggle offline to see error states.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Decoding succeeds for sample payloads  
- [ ] Errors surfaced gracefully  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add API client  
- [ ] Add Codable models  
- [ ] Implement simple retry/backoff  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Data appears in tabs once wired  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates networking with local backend  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

iOS networking layer ready for integrating with tab views.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm backend base URL for dev/prod.  
- Confirm minimal fields needed for v1 UI.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Networking layer implemented and tested.  
- User confirms base URLs and model fields.
