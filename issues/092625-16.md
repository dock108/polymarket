# Issue 092625-16: Caching, Rate Limits, and Error Handling

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Backend / Reliability  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (stability for first use)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Add caching, request timeouts/retries, and graceful error handling for upstream API failures, returning HTTP 503 when appropriate and logging details.

## Investigation Areas

1. fastapi-cache or per-service memoization  
2. httpx/requests timeouts and retry strategy  
3. Structured logging format and correlation ids  

## Expected Behavior

Endpoints remain responsive; transient upstream failures do not crash the app; callers get clear 503s and logs contain actionable details.

## Files to Investigate

- `backend/app/services/*.py`  
- `backend/app/main.py` and middleware  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No resilience patterns implemented.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Multiple external APIs  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early MVP stage  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Caching (⏳ In Progress)
- Cache frequent reads with TTL and keys by params.  

### 2. Timeouts/Retries (⏳ In Progress)
- Set connect/read timeouts and limited retries with backoff.  

### 3. Error Handling (⏳ In Progress)
- Map upstream failures to 503; ensure consistent error schema.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `backend/app/services/*`

**Before**:
```text
Direct upstream calls; no cache/retry; generic errors.
```

**After**:
```text
Calls wrapped with cache + retry; errors mapped to 503 with logs.
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Simulate upstream timeouts; verify retries and 503 behavior.  
2. Validate cache hits reduce upstream traffic.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Retries capped and backoff applied  
- [ ] Cache TTL respected  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add caching layer  
- [ ] Configure timeouts/retries  
- [ ] Implement error mapping/logging  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Resilience behavior verified  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates reliability under light network issues  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Backend becomes resilient with cache, retries, and clear error responses.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm default TTLs and retry counts/backoff.  
- Confirm error schema/messages acceptable for UI.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Resilience patterns implemented and verified.  
- User confirms TTLs/retry settings and error responses.
