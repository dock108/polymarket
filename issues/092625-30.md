# Issue 092625-30: Post-Integration Observability

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: Monitoring / Observability  
**Beta Blocker**: No (but improves reliability)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Add lightweight metrics/logging dashboards and alerting for repeated upstream failures to detect issues post-integration.

## Investigation Areas

1. Logging structure and sinks (stdout/files)  
2. Minimal metrics (e.g., API call counts, error rates)  
3. Alert policy for repeated failures  

## Expected Behavior

Operators can view recent errors and call volumes; repeated upstream failures trigger a notification (e.g., Slack/Discord).

## Files to Investigate

- `backend/app/logging.py` (to be added)  
- `deploy/observability/*` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No observability configured yet.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: MVP focus.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Post-integration task.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Logging + Metrics (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Standardize log format; emit counts and error metrics; basic dashboard or log query examples.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new files/configs will be added`

**Before**:
```text
No dashboards or alerts.
```

**After**:
```text
backend/app/logging.py
deploy/observability/*
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Trigger a known error; verify it appears in logs/metrics.  
2. Simulate repeated upstream failures; confirm alert message delivered.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Logs structured and searchable  
- [ ] Alert fires on threshold  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add structured logging  
- [ ] Emit minimal metrics  
- [ ] Configure alerting  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Dashboards/alerts functional  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates alert delivery and dashboards  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Basic observability for early detection of issues and failure patterns.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm preferred alert channel (Slack/Discord) and webhook/credentials.  
- Confirm key metrics to display on dashboard.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Observability configured and verified.  
- User confirms alert channel and metrics.
