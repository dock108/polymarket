# Issue 092625-4: Dockerize Backend and Local Compose

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: DevOps / Docker  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (local + deploy workflow)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Resolved**: 2025-09-26

## Problem Description

We need a Dockerized backend with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for local development and to pave the way for Hetzner deployment. Include health checks and environment wiring.

## Investigation Areas

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile (build -> runtime).  
2. Uvicorn/Gunicorn startup command and healthcheck.  
3. Compose services for API and SQLite volume.  

## Expected Behavior

`docker compose up` builds and runs the API, exposing the port, with env variables passed via `.env`. Health check indicates running state.

## Files to Investigate

- `backend/Dockerfile` (to be added)  
- `docker-compose.yml` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No containerization currently.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: Need parity between dev and prod.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early project stage.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dockerfile (✅ Complete)
- Install deps; copy app; run via gunicorn UvicornWorker; container healthcheck on `/health`.  

### 2. Compose (✅ Complete)
- API service with port mapping, `.env` injection, and volume for SQLite.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new files will be created`

**Before**:
```text
No Docker/dev environment.
```

**After**:
```text
backend/Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.dockerignore
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. `docker compose up --build` in repo root.  
2. Verify `/health` returns OK in container.  

### Test Scenarios
- [x] Container builds successfully  
- [x] Healthcheck passes  
- [x] Env vars wired into container  

## Status

**Current Status**: RESOLVED  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Add Dockerfile  
- [x] Add docker-compose.yml  
- [x] Add healthcheck  
- [x] Document usage in README  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [x] Compose up runs API  
- [x] Healthcheck green  
- [x] Ready for user testing  
- [x] Blockers documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [x] User ran compose successfully  
- [x] User confirms API reachable  
- [x] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Backend is containerized with local compose for consistent development and deployment.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm port exposure and any local port preferences.  
- Confirm environment variable mapping and file mount locations.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Dockerfile and compose function end-to-end.  
- User validated compose startup and API access.
