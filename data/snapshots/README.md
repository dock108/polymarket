# Snapshot Fixtures

This directory contains small, curated JSON snapshots for deterministic tests and local debugging.

- `pm_markets.json` — Polymarket markets sample (binary Yes/No).
- `sb_odds.json` — Sportsbook odds sample with H2H markets.

Use loaders in tests to reproduce joins and EV calculations.
