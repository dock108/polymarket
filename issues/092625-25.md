# Issue 092625-25: iOS Build and Minimal CI

**Priority**: Medium  
**Component**: DevOps / iOS CI  
**Beta Blocker**: No (but recommended for stability)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Add a GitHub Actions workflow to build the iOS target (no signing required) and run unit tests if present to catch regressions early.

## Investigation Areas

1. macOS runner selection and Xcode version.  
2. Caching derived data and dependencies.  
3. Test scheme selection and headless execution.  

## Expected Behavior

Pushes/PRs trigger an iOS build workflow; tests run and results are surfaced in PR checks.

## Files to Investigate

- `.github/workflows/ios.yml` (to be added)  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No iOS CI pipeline.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: New iOS app.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early stage.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. iOS CI Workflow (‚è≥ In Progress)
- Build app target; run unit tests if a test target exists.  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - new workflow will be added`

**Before**:
```text
No iOS CI.
```

**After**:
```text
.github/workflows/ios.yml
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open PR; verify iOS build job runs.  
2. Add a trivial test; confirm it executes in CI.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Build succeeds on PR  
- [ ] Tests reported in checks  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add workflow file  
- [ ] Configure Xcode version  
- [ ] Enable tests in CI  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] iOS build job green on PR  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User sees iOS CI status on PRs  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

iOS build workflow catches build/test issues before merges.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm workflow triggers (branches/PRs).  
- Confirm build scheme and target name.  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- iOS CI workflow added and passing.  
- User confirms scheme/trigger settings.
