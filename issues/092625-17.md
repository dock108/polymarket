# Issue 092625-17: Backend Tests and Quality Gates

**Priority**: High  
**Component**: Backend / QA  
**Beta Blocker**: Yes (stability for merges)  
**Discovered**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: New  
**Resolved**: 

## Problem Description

Add unit/integration tests (pytest) for math utilities and services, and configure linters/formatters to maintain quality with ~80% coverage target.

## Investigation Areas

1. pytest structure and fixtures  
2. black/flake8/isort configuration  
3. Coverage measurement and thresholds  

## Expected Behavior

`pytest` runs locally and in CI; coverage summary meets threshold; linting passes; PRs are blocked on failures.

## Files to Investigate

- `backend/tests/*`  
- `pyproject.toml` or config files  

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Primary Cause**: No tests/linters configured yet.  
2. **Contributing Factors**: New repo.  
3. **Why It Happened**: Early MVP stage.  

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Tests (⏳ In Progress)
- Add tests for `odds.py`, services mocks, and basic API routes.  

### 2. Linters/Formatters (⏳ In Progress)
- Configure black/flake8/isort and pre-commit (optional).  

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `N/A - tests and configs to be added`

**Before**:
```text
No tests or linting.
```

**After**:
```text
backend/tests/test_odds.py
backend/tests/test_routes.py
pyproject.toml (or separate configs)
```

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Run `pytest -q` and ensure pass.  
2. Run linters; fix any violations.  

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Coverage >= 80%  
- [ ] Lint passes  

## Status

**Current Status**: Planned  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add unit tests  
- [ ] Add integration tests  
- [ ] Configure lint/format  

### Completion Criteria (Ready for User Testing)
- [ ] Tests green locally  
- [ ] Ready for user testing  
- [ ] Any blockers clearly documented  

### User Testing Confirmation
- [ ] User validates tests run and coverage  
- [ ] User approves moving to done/complete  

## Result

Quality gates in place with tests and linters raising confidence for merges.

---

## User Confirmation & Actions Required

- Confirm coverage target (80% default).  
- Confirm preferred tooling (black/flake8/isort/pre-commit).  

## Definition of Done (including user confirmations)

- Tests and linting configured and passing.  
- User confirms thresholds and tools.
